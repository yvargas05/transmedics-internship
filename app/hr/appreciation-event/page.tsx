                This July I was able to full plan, develop and organize the Intern Appreciation Day Event for the Summer 2025 Interns. This event was a great way to show appreciation for the interns and all of their hard work over the summer. I was able to coordinate with a local womens shelter to donate hyginene bags that the interns assembled during the event over lunch. Addiotnally, I collaborated with managers across the comoany to create a slideshow for each of their interns to express their graditiude and appreciation for the work they did over the summer. I was able to provide food, drinks and dessert for the interns and managers by ordering catering to enjoy during the event. I am grateful to be given full control over the planning and cordination of this event because I was able to devlop a meaningful event for the interns, and managers while giving back to people in need. I was able to gain confidence in my project management skills and trust my descisions in planning this event. Even with the challenges that came with planning this event, I was able to see the impact it had on everyone who attended and I am proud of the work I did to make it a success.
