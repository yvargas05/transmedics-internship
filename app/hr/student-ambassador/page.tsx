         In additon to the short term projects I worked on this summer, I was able to provide assistance in creating long term programs and larger projects that will be implemented in the future. One of these projects was the Student Ambassador Program, a program that will allow TransMedics to engage with local students and universities to promote the importance of organ donation and the TransMedics mission. I researched local student organizations and clubs related to healthcare, medical devices, medical engineering and more to find a target demographic that would be interested in this program. With this program, I hope to create a community of students that are passionate about organ donation and introduce them to the innovative work that TransMedics is doing in the field of organ transplantation. With a series of events and acitvies, I hope to inspire a new generation of students to get involved with TransMedics and develop a passion for healthcare innovation. I am excited to see this program grow in the future, and I hope to launch the first chapter at Tufts University this year.
